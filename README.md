## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Live Data Fetching
The system fetches real-time NAV data from AMFI:

- Parses raw text file
- Extracts scheme code, scheme name, NAV, date
- Automatically classifies funds into categories

---

### 2️⃣ Historical Storage Engine

Every time the app runs:

- Today’s NAV is appended to `nav_history.csv`
- Duplicate entries for the same day are removed
- NAV is converted to numeric
- Invalid rows are discarded

This allows time-series performance analysis.

---

### 3️⃣ Time-Series Analytics Engine

Using historical NAV:

- Daily returns are computed
- Annualized return is calculated
- Annualized volatility is computed
- Sharpe Ratio is calculated:

```
Sharpe = (Annual Return - Risk Free Rate) / Volatility
```

Funds with insufficient history are skipped.

### 4️⃣ Risk Alignment Model

Each fund is assigned a risk score based on keywords:

| Fund Type | Risk Score |
|-----------|------------|
| Small Cap | 1.0 |
| Mid Cap   | 0.85 |
| Large Cap | 0.6 |
| Liquid    | 0.1 |
| Others    | 0.5 |

User risk mapping:

| User Input | Risk Value |
|------------|-----------|
| Low        | 0.2 |
| Medium     | 0.6 |
| High       | 1.0 |

Risk Alignment Formula:

```
1 - abs(Fund_Risk - User_Risk)
```

---

### 5️⃣ Final Recommendation Score

Funds are ranked using:

```
Score = 0.6 × Sharpe Ratio + 0.4 × Risk Alignment
```

Top N funds are returned.

---

### 6️⃣ SIP Growth Simulator

Uses compound interest formula:

```
Future Value = SIP × [((1+r)^n - 1)/r] × (1+r)
```

Displays:
- Total Invested
- Future Value
- Wealth Gained
- Growth chart

## 🧠 Explainable AI Layer

For every recommended fund:

- Risk match explanation
- Investment horizon consideration
- Risk-adjusted performance shown
- Final score transparency
